# Kotlin OOP Task 1 - Gnomes

This task and the others in this series are intended to test and reinforce your understanding of the Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) paradigm, and its use via the Kotlin language.

## Task Notes

A bunch of gnomes have appeared in your garden!

```
   /\      /\      /\
  ('')    (oo)    (xx)
__{__}____{__}____{__}__
```

Each gnome has a particular activity that it specialises in: fishing, digging, smoking a pipe, etc.

Gnomes are generally friendly little things, but they do have a bad temper when provoked. If you poke them, they will get cross. Often a pat on head can help calm them down.
